Unless explicitly stated otherwise at the beginning of the file, all jel/os files are licensed under
the MIT license above.

The jel/os directory contains all RTOS abstractions in addition to numerous useful system level
utilities and data types.

An application making use of the jel should only include files at the os directory root that begin
with api_. The implementation of these routines, including specific RTOS calls, are defined within
the os/internal folder and should not be included in the application.
