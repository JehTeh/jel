/** @file os/api_allocator.hpp
 *  @brief Provides the interface components used for all allocators compatabile with jel.
 *
 *  @detail
 *    The allocator API classes provide various dynamic memory related objects. These include:
 *      -A generic heap allocator statistics interface. Heaps that implement this interface are
 *      tracked in the global heap registry, allowing for easy access to detailed information about
 *      the memory consumption of a given heap.
 *      -An interface to the primary system allocator. The system allocator exposes the heap that is
 *      used by the new/delete and malloc/free functions. Generally speaking, allocations should be
 *      made via calls to new/delete, but because these calls are piped through the system
 *      allocator, it is acceptable to use the SystemAllocator::systemAllocator()->allocate or
 *      ->deallocate() calls interchangebly with memory returned by operator new() and malloc().
 *      -An 'object pool' template class, which provides a generic threadsafe container for storing
 *      re-usable objects. This is useful for cases where a shared resource is required between
 *      multiple threads and is commonly grabbed and released. Instead of system allocator calls to
 *      create and destroy new objects every time they are needed, which are considerably more
 *      expensive, a object pool can be used. Objects are retrieved from the pool inside of an
 *      ObjectContainer; the container class provides RAII gaurantees ensuring that objects grabbed
 *      from the pool will be returned when the container is destroyed.
 *      -A block allocator class. This is a specalized allocator (that is *not* inherently
 *      threadsafe) that can be used when multiple allocations of objects in multiples of the block
 *      size are expected. It is generally considerably faster than the system heap implementation
 *      using a linked list; large differences between object size and block size can, however,
 *      waste significant amounts of memory.
 *
 *  @todo
 *    -Implement a specialized heap fragmentation visualizer. This will be primarily a debug tool
 *    used to 'see' heap fragmentation (ideally via the CLI). Multiple tool implementations will
 *    likely be required for different heap types (i.e. muli-linked list vs block allocator) but
 *    should share a common abstracted interface that the visualizer can use to draw the in-use and
 *    free memory, as well as provide statistics on allocated and free block distributions and
 *    sizes.
 *    -Match STL allocator implementation. This will likely be done by expanding upon the
 *    AllocatorInterface class. This needs to be done to allow use of std::string/std::vector and
 *    other containers but with a custom allocator (for example, using external SDRAM memory).
 *    -Override STL/g++ exception allocation scheme. A custom/separate heap with fallback to the
 *    system one is more desirable here; this is to significantly reduce uncertainty in exception
 *    throw() times. Essentially, instead of relying on a seperate shared storage block only for
 *    fallback on OOM exceptions, rely on a threadsafe shared block normally with fallback on the
 *    system heap or system terminate().

/** @class ObjectPool
 *  @brief A 'pool' of a given object that allows RAII acquisition and release of an object stored

 *
 *  The ObjectPool provides a threadsafe manner of managing any generic objects. Objects are stored
 *  internally in the pool in a queue, and when acquired, are stored in a RAII container that will
 *  ensure the object is returned to the pool after it is no longer in use. This can be useful for
 *  items that need to be shared across multiple threads, and when frequent
 *  allocations/de-allocations are not desired. For example, internally all jel strings are stored
 *  in an object pool (technically, std::unique_ptr<String> are stored) allowing shared use by the
 *  CLI and logging threads as needed. This allows the jel to pre-allocate string buffers of an
 *  appropriate size and not require multiple expensive system allocator calls whenever printing to
 *  a logging buffer or using CLI functionality.
 *  
 *  Example of object pool use:
 *  @code
 *    ObjectPool<String, 10> sPool(); //Create a pool of 10 Strings
 *    ... <Do other things>
 *    {
 *      auto sContainer = sPool.acquire(); //Returns a ObjectContainer storing a String.
 *      std::sprintf(sContainer.stored().data(), "test %d",7); //Write a generic test to the string.
 *      std::printf(sContainer.stored().c_str()); //Print the string.
 *    } //The String automatically returns to the pool here when it falls out of scope.
